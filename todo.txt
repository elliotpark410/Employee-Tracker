Hannah Folk's Tip: 
    Inquirer choices array can take in an array of objects in this format

        [
          {
            "name": "Software Engineer",
            "value": 1
          },
          {
            "name": "Lead Engineer",
            "value": 2
          },
        ]

    If you do that, then the inquirer will show the name in the terminal
    but if you console log the answers then actually its the value that shows up in the console log

    Thatâ€™s gonna make your life a lot easier for the add and update statements since the values are the same as the ids
    anyway, not sure if you already knew that about inquirer, but that tip is super helpful for htis hw
